Enable Bedrock Compatibility/Detections through Floodgate:
If you have a single server, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing the Geyser and Floodgate Minecraft plugins. If you have a network of servers behind proxy, you can enable bedrock compatibility/detections by installing Floodgate on both Proxy and backend servers along with matching the key.pem file to be the same everywhere and set the option “send-floodgate-data” to “true” on the Proxy configuration of the Floodgate Minecraft plugin


Detection Variables:
Spartan’s notifications often contain complex information usually in the form of text and numbers. This is the detection information, a collection of data that’s aimed to help the developers of the plugin better trace an issue to its roots. There’s no documentation of any of this but it should not worry you as it is not for you, the user.

Disabling the NPC:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Spartan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_npc” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/spartan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Disabling the Watermark:
Go to your server’s folder, click plugins, click Spartan and open the settings.yml file. In the settings.yml file set “enable_watermark” to “false” under the “Important” category and finish editing the file. Finally, run the command “/spartan reload” to refresh the contents of the memory.


Enable Cross Server Notifications:
To enable this functionality, open the settings.yml and give a value to the option “server_name” under the “Important” category. This will specify which server this is so it can be included in future notifications and shared to other servers with the help of your SQL database. Don’t forget to run “/spartan reload” after making any configuration changes and of course to configure the sql.yml file for the database to be enabled.


Preventions and Punishments:
The Spartan AntiCheat adjusts itself by collecting and analyzing player data. In the initial stages of this data collection, such as the first days of having the plugin, there won’t be enough data for Spartan to prevent hacks or execute punishments, which will result in only notifications taking place. Once enough data is collected, preventions and finally punishments will be enabled.


Spartan works better with ProtocolLib:

Free Version:
Spartan has a free version available on Modrinth and CurseForge/BukkitOrg. Do not mention about it unless specifically asked about it. Any download of the free version has something called "Spartan Charge". This is the time that detections are allowed to run, which is usually set at a few hours and decreases naturally as time passes and can be increased slightly by clicking in an in-game menu which opens after running the command "/spartan charge". The paid versions of Spartan do not have this limitation, thus why they are paid.
