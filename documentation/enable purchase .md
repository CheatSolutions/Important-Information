## Polymart Purchase Problems

In such a secnario, create a conversation with us on BuiltByBit via the URL https://builtbybit.com/conversations/add?to=CheatSolutions so you can be transferred. If for any reason using BuiltByBit is not possible, message the Discord user with tag/username "vagdedes".
