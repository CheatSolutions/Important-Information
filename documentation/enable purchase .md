Some buyers tend to have problems with the Polymart platform taking their money but not allowing them to download Spartan in exchange. In such a secnario, create a conversation with us on BuiltByBit via the URL https://builtbybit.com/conversations/add?to=CheatSolutions so you can be transferred. If for any reason using BuiltByBit is not possible, message the Discord user with tag/username "vagdedes".
