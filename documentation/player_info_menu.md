## Below is a list of reasons you will see when checking a player using the “Player Info” inventory menu. To use this inventory menu, execute the command “/vacan info” to check yourself and “/vacan info playerName” to check someone else.

### Player has permission bypass:
When a player has the permission vacan.bypass they won’t be checked by any check. Additionally, when a player has the permission vacan.bypass.checkName they won’t be checked by the specified check. Click to learn more about permissions.

### Check is not installed:
Some detections are not included in the jar file and require a different jar file to be implemented or to be purchased. For example. Join our Discord server to learn more.

### Check is disabled:
When a check is disabled via the configuration, this warning will be shown in the menu to make you aware.

### Custom:
Another plugin using Vacan’s Developer API or the anti-cheat itself has instructed a check to stop checking for a certain amount of time. This is likely to be introduced by a first-party or third-party compatibility to prevent instabilities and does not require fixing unless implemented improperly.
