###### Additionally: (1) For many checks/detections to work, the ProtocolLib plugin must be properly installed. (2) For geysermc/bedrock checks/detections to work, the Floodgate plugin must be properly installed OR a prefix to all geysermc/bedrock players must be applied OR a specific Spartan permission must be applied to all geysermc/bedrock players.
