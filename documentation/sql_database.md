## DISCLAIMER
Mixing data of different gameplays in one or a few SQL database tables is NOT RECOMMENDED. You should create a table for each individual gameplay your server/network has. For example: SkyWars, BedWars, Parkour, Survival, e.t.c. Generalizing data in one or a few tables that cover different gameplays will cause the statistics of Vacan to not properly understand the circumstances of a given server, potentially leading to problems such as increased false positives, bypasses and more!
