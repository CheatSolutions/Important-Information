## A. False Detections / False Positives
```
Step 1: Run the command “/spartan verbose” to enable non-important notifications so you do not miss crucial information, this is always recommended when testing.
```
```
Step 2: Run the command “/spartan notifications 0” to enable low frequency notifications so you are notified about all detections, this is always recommended when testing.
```
```
Step 3: Screenshot the spartan notification messages in your Minecraft chat so our developers can figure out which detections are responsible for the faultiness.
```
```
Step 4: Attach the screenshots as files or URLs to the ticket you are about to send us and provide a short but clear description of what you did so our developers can attempt to reproduce your problem.
```

## B. Hack Bypass / Check Testing
